This has definitely been a fun challenge so far! I knew it would be a lot of work but I still underestimated how much.

I've used dev tools to get colors and font sizes but have been working out the structure on my own.

I wasn't confident about importing icons before starting and opted to download them as svg files instead. I would probably not make the same choice again. The additional html for each icon makes it more difficult to find other elements, attributes, etc when I need to make changes.

I think my git workflow could still use some work. I find myself making several big changes and bundling them in a single commit and recognize that this would lead to a lot of extra work if I did need to go back. I did successfully restore an earlier commit when needed but am still not very confident about handling pull requests from the command line.
